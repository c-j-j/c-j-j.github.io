One of the things that I struggled initially with vim was navigating around a document quickly. Up until recently, I was using H,J,K,L to traverse lines and characters and is a slow and cumbersome way of navigating. I'll be referring to ruby in this post, however the techniques here are applicable to most other languages.<br /><br />Here are a few tips that I've recently picked up to help traverse files quicker.<br /><br /><h3>Search for the text you are navigating to</h3><div>If there is a ruby method that you'd like to navigate to which is on a different line than you're currently on, you can type the following to help you reach that method faster</div><div><br /></div><div><ol><li>Type / to get into search mode</li><li>Type the prefix of the text you are searching for, e.g. "some_method"</li><li>Press enter to navigate to that text</li><li>If there are multiple search results, use 'n' and 'N' to go to next/previous occurs.</li><li>TIP: if the target method is above where you are, use ? instead of / to search backwards</li></ol><h3>Traverse methods quickly</h3></div><div>To traverse your code one method at a time, you have two options</div><div><ol><li>use the technique above to search for "def" (if you're using ruby), then use 'n' and 'N' to go forward and backward</li><li>if you're methods are well formatted and have line breaks between them, use Control-{ or Control-} to go to the next line break.</li></ol><h3>Go to a particular position on the current line</h3></div><div>The 'f' command can be used to find a character on your current line, and ';' and ',' are used to go forward and backwards if there are multiple occurrences.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is best used if you are traversing to special characters like brackets, commas, etc, as there are usually fewer occurrences of these.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Use % to go to matching def/end</h3><div>More recent vim versions have built in plugins that can help you traverse ruby code. You can use the % key to go to a particular matching bracket, or if working in ruby you can find matching def/class/end pairs.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Marking bookmarks using 'm'</h3><div>Vim allows you to leave bookmarks so that you can jump to various locations of your document. To set a mark, do the following</div><div><ol><li>type m</li><li>type a letter from a-z</li><li>To traverse to this mark, press `[a-z]. This gives you 26 possible bookmarks to make in a vim document.</li></ol><h3>Use ` to jump around</h3></div><div>The backquote character can be used to jump around the document to areas of previous interest. For example,</div><div><br /></div><div>`` &nbsp; goes to the last jump locations</div><div>`. &nbsp; goes to previous change location</div><div>`^ &nbsp;goes to previous insertion location</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>For more tips, check out the book Practical Vim by Drew Neil where I have learnt these from.</div><div><br /></div>
