Here are a few simple plugins that you may add to vim that'll help you write and test Ruby code. NOTE: I used pathogen to install these plugins.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible">vim-sensible</a>&nbsp;- several decent additions to standard vim that make development easier, i.e. having backspace in insert mode, immediately go to next search result, etc. It also loads matchit.vim - which allows you to use the % key to jump from start/end of Ruby classes/methods/blocks.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs">auto-pairs</a>&nbsp;- Automatically closes parenthesis, quotes, etc and puts your cursor in the correct place to begin typing. It also handles deletion of brackets properly.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">vim-surround</a>&nbsp;- Allows you to wrap existing text in&nbsp;parenthesis/quotes, and provides ability to remove brackets and quotes from existing text.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise">vim-endwise</a>&nbsp;- Automatically adds "end" when writing Ruby code, for e.g. when defining a module/class/method/block, etc.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/vim-rspec">vim-rspec</a>&nbsp;- Allows you to run rspec tests in the current terminal. I prefer this compared to using a separate terminal window for rspec output as I prefer having the whole screen dedicated to test output during failures.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/ecomba/vim-ruby-refactoring">vim-ruby-refactoring</a>&nbsp;- This has a number of functions that allow you to refactor things like variables, extract methods and so on.<br /><br />
